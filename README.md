> Today I Learned

My collection of technical notes gathered daily across different technologies. The second brain system I'm most proud of. Inspired by [simonw/til](https://github.com/simonw/til) and [jbranchaud/til](https://github.com/jbranchaud/til).

## Introduction

I have been mentally torn apart when finding answers to how to organize everything I have learned so far. 

My failed attempts when trying to implement a *second brain*:

**Methodologies**:
* [Johnny.Decimal](https://johnnydecimal.com)
* [PARA](https://fortelabs.com/blog/para/)

**Applications**:
* [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md)

=> But they all shares two common problems: **Complex hierarchical structure.** and **Those notes will never be re-read**.

To my best outcome, I've built a [Silverbullet069/.dotfiles] repository. But general documentation and context-specific tweaks are stored together, which isn't my preferred approach. However, it still has its pros: quick look-up.

TIL, or Today I Learned, is my newest approach to tackle the problem.
