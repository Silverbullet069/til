# TIL

> Today I Learned

My collection of technical notes gathered daily across different technologies. The second brain system I'm most proud of. Inspired by [simonw/til](https://github.com/simonw/til) and [jbranchaud/til](https://github.com/jbranchaud/til).

## Introduction

I have been mentally torn apart when finding answers to how to organize everything I have learned so far.

My failed attempts when trying to implement a _second brain_:

**Methodologies**:

- [Johnny.Decimal](https://johnnydecimal.com)
- [PARA](https://fortelabs.com/blog/para/)

**Applications**:

- [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md)

=> But they all shares two common problems: **Complex hierarchical structure.** and **Those notes will never be re-read**.

To my best outcome, I've built a [Silverbullet069/.dotfiles](https://github.com/Silverbullet069/dotfiles) repository. But general documentation and context-specific tweaks are stored together, which isn't my preferred approach. However, it still has its pros: quick look-up.

TIL, or Today I Learned, is my newest approach to tackle the problem.

## FAQ

_Q: When should I write a TIL note?_
A: Requirements come up by me to eliminate nitty-gritty thinking and duplication problem:

- Applies to a specific problems while building a feature. DO NOT WRITE ABOUT THE FEATURE ITSELF, WE HAVE GITHUB ISSUES FOR IT!
- Uses in a lot of repositories. Usually optimization tricks for productivity, secutity, reliability, ...
- Acquired by reading a blog post or multiple references.
- Requires code snippets. Non-code knowledge are to be put inside Anki decks.
- Takes a significant amount of time to figure out.

> [!CAUTION]
> Ignored things that can simply be _Googled_, that's Google's job!
