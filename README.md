# TIL

> Today I Learned

My collection of technical notes gathered daily across different technologies. The second brain system I'm most proud of. Inspired by [simonw/til](https://github.com/simonw/til).

## Introduction

I have been torn aparted mentally when search for the answer for the question: **How to record and organize everything I have learned so far**.

My attempts when trying to implement a _second brain_:

**Methodologies**:

- [Johnny.Decimal](https://johnnydecimal.com)
- [PARA](https://fortelabs.com/blog/para/)

**Applications**:

- [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md)

However, they all share common pitfalls:

- Deeply nested structure. Searching for specific knowledge requires wasting precious time.
- Overlap between non-code/low-code and code-intensive knowledge.
- Re-reading occurs rarely, sometimes never.
- [Learn in Private](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-private) instead of [Learn in Public](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public).

**TIL**, or _Today I Learned_, is my newest approach to tackle all of the above problems.

## The learning cycle

I've curated a **FOUR**-step process:

![the-learning-cycle.svg](the-learning-cycle.svg)

- **Step 1:** Start with basic tutorial from 3rd-party learning materials. [Roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh) is also a great place to start. **Avoid thoroughly reading official documentations until you're familiar with the tool.**
- **Step 2:** Run in local playground. Set up the development environment, write the code snippets, run the commands you found in Step 1.
- **Step 3:** Write a TIL. Plug all the separate pieces into ONE grand picture: making cheatsheet (CLI commands, programming language code snippets, ...) to insights (why this feature existed, in which situation do we use it, ...)
  > This is the hardest step.
- **Step 4:** Practice in a real project. Remember what you learned, and if you don't, constantly re-check TIL and playground.
- **Refer to advanced learning materials:** official documentations, senior engineers' blogs, best practices, ...

## Personal Experience

1. **Everything you READ will be forgotten**:

   - You will forget the long and comprehensive documentation page that you read a month ago.
   - You will forget the interesting blog post from your favorite bloggers that you read three months ago.
   - You will forget the APIs of your favorite programming languages and their frameworks/libraries that you used six months ago.
   - You will forget the commands, sub-commands, arguments, options of the CLI utilities you haven't touched for a year.

   => **Unless, you write a TIL**.

1. **You don't need to remember it!**: Do not record anything that can be Googled/AI-generated under 5 seconds

1. **Do not record anything that can be Googled/AI-generated under 5 seconds**: consider breaking that TIL into multiple smaller TILs.

   > However, if the TIL is a single source of truth, or you want to avoid context switching to the fullest, a big TIL is not a problem. You should include a **TL;DR**, a **Cheatsheet** or a **ToC** at the start though.

1. **Blog what you built and what other people built, Record what you learned**: Simon Willison's have two separated platforms for sharing his knowledge: [Weblog](https://simonwillison.net) ([GitHub](https://github.com/simonw/simonwillisonblog)) and [Today I Learned](https://til.simonwillison.net) ([GitHub](https://github.com/simonw/til)). I realized he blogged about his projects, big tech innovations, ... and he wrote TIL for a random thing that he learned to solve a very fine-grained problem.

1. **Always be grateful:** you must include a **## References** section at the bottom of your TIL.
