# Git Best Practices

<!-- tl;dr starts -->

Learn how to use Git properly before doing anything else is my motto.

<!-- tl;dr ends -->

## Cheatsheet

Less commonly used `git` subcommands:

```sh
# mark commit, which can be referred later on merging, rebasing, ...
# versioning is one of its use cases
git tag -s v1.0.0

# add content to commit without updating the SHA-1 of the commit
# super useful
git notes add -m "Note #1"
git notes add -f -m "Note #1 updated"

# see the list of files which were updated during 2 commits/tags
git whatchanged commit1_sha...commit2_sha
git whatchanged v1.0.0...HEAD
```

## Branching strategy + Clean commit history

For me, I use **a hybrid of Gitflow and Feature branching**.

## Branch protection rules

Before a PR can be merged:

1. Require pull request reviews: a certain numbers of reviewers approve the PR.
1. Require status checks.

   - Status checks can be divided into 2 types: Checks and Commit Statuses.
   - Checks provide line annotations, more detailed messaging, is only available for use with GitHub Apps.
   - GitHub Actions generates Checks when workflows are run.
   - A repository can be set to automatically request status checks for pushes.
   - Organization owners + Users with Push access can create status checks with GitHub's API.

1. Require conversation resolution: all conversations on a PR must be resolved.
1. Require signed commits: all commits must be signed with a verified signature
1. Require linear history: the commit history of a PR must be linear
1. Require merge queue: the PR are merged using a merge queue using GitHub Actions.
1. Require deployments to succeed: deployments to production environment must succeed.
1. Do not allow bypassing
1. Restrict who can push to matching branches.
1. Disallow force pushes and deletions (default).

## .gitignore

- Install []()
- Logs, caches, temporary files. Including test results, test logs
- Build artifacts
- Sensitive information (`.env` files, SSH private key, ... )
  > NOTE: do not hardcode API Key into codebase, you will regret it later!
- Large files (media, binary, compressed archive, ...). Use Git LFS.
- Install [CodeZombie's VSCode Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=codezombiech.gitignore)

## .gitmodules

```sh
# Remove submodule
# cre: https://gist.github.com/myusuf3/7f645819ded92bda6677

# remove the submodule entry from .git/config
$ git submodule deinit -f path/to/submodule # or nano .git/config and remove the modules

# remove the submodule directory from the suporproject .git/modules directory
$ rm -rf .git/modules/path/to/submodule

# remove the entry in .gitmodules + the submodule directory in filesystem
$ git rm -f path/to/submodule
# or nano .gitmodules, remove the entries + rm -rf path/to/submodule

# (optional) if you have commited the submodule previously, re-commit
$ git commit -m "removed submodule"
```

## GitHub Actions for CI/CD

Here are the things that you can automate:

- Build
- Tests
- Deploy
- Releases
- Documentation
- IaC
- Security check
- ... and more

## GitHub Issues + GitHub Projects for Project Management

GitHub Issues is a powerful issue tracking system that allow you to manage and track issues:

- Feature requests.
- Bugs.
- FAQs.
- ...

GitHub Projects is a tool for planning and tracking work on GitHub, more specifically, issues from GitHub Issues.

- Plan and prioritize issues (MoSCoW/Eisenhower Matrix)
- Use Kanban board view.
- Use milestones to manage releases.
- Collaborate and communicate with team members.
- Use labels when categorizing issues.

## GitHub security features

1. Enable Dependency Graph

   - It analyzes the manifest and lock files in a repository, in order to help users understand the upstream packages that their software project depends on.
   - It can analyze both direct dependency and transitive dependency (i.e. the dependency of your direct dependency).
   - GitHub's Dependency Graph can display transitive dependency if package ecosystems support display them in their dependency graph.
   - In some ecosystems, the resolution of transitive dependencies only occurs at build-time, therefore the contents of the repository alone can't help GitHub discovering all dependencies.

   => Enable Automatic Dependency Submission can help this problem. **However, you must maintain a `pom.xml` file in your project, and `pom.xml` is only existed in a Maven project.**

1. Web UI > Security: Security Overview
   GitHub have a very nice dashboard to control every security aspects of this repository, some notables are:

   - Dependabot alerts
   - Code scanning alerts
   - Secret scanning alerts

1. GitHub's Secret Scanning: It's not uncommon to accidentally commit sensitive credentials like API Keys and passwords.

1. Code Scanning: CodeQL is semantic analysis engine that scans your code for potential vulnerabilities (e.g. SQL Injection). A default config is more than enough. 3rd-party code scanning tools can further enhance your code's security such as: SonarCloud, TfSec (Terraform), trivy, Snyk, ...

1. Enable Dependabot Security Updates

   - It monitors your dependencies and sends alerts when it encounters any vulnerabilities. It can automatically update your dependencies to the latest secure version, depending on how serious the vulnerabilities are.

   - Not only security updates does it run but also non-security updates such as bumping out-of-date dependency version.

   - Dependabot uses a YAML file called `dependabot.yml` stored at `.github/dependabot.yml` in the default branch to maintain dependencies using version updates, it can change how Dependabot creates PR for security updates.

   When `dependabot.yml` gets added or updated, Dependabot will immediately trigger status check

   ```yml
   # To get started with Dependabot version updates, you'll need to specify which
   # package ecosystems to update and where the package manifests are located.
   # Please see the documentation for all configuration options:
   # https://docs.github.com/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-version-updates/configuration-options-for-the-dependabot.yml-file

   version: 2
   updates:
     # define a package manager to update
     - package-ecosystem: "npm"
       # Docs: https://github.blog/changelog/2024-04-29-dependabot-multi-directory-configuration-public-beta-now-available/
       directories:
         - "/" # bats-core
         - "/tests/test_helper/bats-*" # bats library
       schedule:
         interval: "weekly"
       open-pull-requests-limit: 2
       reviewers:
         - "Silverbullet069"
       commit-message:
         prefix: "test"
         include: "scope"
       #target-branch: "main"
   ```

## GitHub Apps

A type of integration to interact and extend the functionality of GitHub.

Use cases:

- Automate task, background process.
- Use GitHub as identity provider.
- As a developer tool, act on the tool's behalf or your behalf.
- Integrate your tool or external service with GitHub.

Installed directly on organizations/personal accounts and granted access to specific repositories. They have narrow, specific permissions.

**Act on behalf of a user:** use a User Access Token for auth, the app will be limited by the permissions that have been given to the app, as well as the permissions enforced to user. User must authorize the app before using the app. e.g. use cases identity provider or add a service on top of GitHub.
