# Language Learning Guide by V.H

## Introduction

Welcome to my language learning guide - one among many that exist on the Internet. As a programmer and pianist, language has multiple forms for me, including:

- human languages
- music languages
- programming languages

For me, they are all languages with multiple ways to "speak" them. "What" and "how" are the two most important questions I will answer. I will skip "why" since these languages chose me, not the other way around.

## Table of contents

## Human languages

### 1. English (the decent way)

### 2. Japanese

#### Philosophy

- Language learning is a process of subconsciously memorising patterns with comprehensible input, those patterns are stored inside your brain for later information retrieval.
- The methods are essential when it comes to learning Japanese to achieve your goals - master 4 major skills to enjoy Japanese content. It's **Tradition + Immersion**:

  - **Immersion** - the act of listening to or reading native content made for native speakers fluently. These conent are untranslated anime, visual novel, manga, newspaper, TV shows, ...
  - **Traditional** is the prerequisite method, then **Immersion** comes in.
  - 9 traditional basic steps according to TheMoeWay to learn: https://learnjapanese.moe/guide/#12-problems-with-traditional-methods

- Move on quickly from basic learning material. There are too many things need to be done and your time is limit. No perfectionism ideals are permitted.
- Language is enormous. You need a lot of experience, that's why Immersion is so important.
- Immersion materials must be at the same level as you. And has to be fun so you won't tire your mind and give up.
- Reading and Listening are input skills, while Speaking and Writing are output skills. Input and output goes hand in hand.

#### Reading

- [TheMoeWay's ratio for reading/listening is 3/7](https://learnjapanese.moe/guide/#ideal-ratio-between-listening-and-reading). But I am not concurred, it should be the other way around.

- Immersion: **read -> look up word -> react -> read -> look up word -> ... (repeat)**. Watching anime with Japanese subtitles or playing Visual Novel JAP version can ease the tediousness of repetition.
  - Using

#### Listening

- Listening has two ways of learning: _Active listening_ and _Passive listening_:

  - **Active Listening:** Pay full attention to the listening. Make the most gains.
  - **Passive Listening:** Do something else while having the listening on in the background. Beneficial for people with busy lifestyles.

- There are 3 levels of listening. Levels 1 and 2 are used for beginner to intermediate levels:

  - **Level 1:** Listen without looking up dictionaries.
  - **Level 2:** Look up dictionaries for things that pop out, but still let the listening play.
  - **Level 3:** Pause at every single unknown word and look them up.

- Immersion per day: watching anime without Japanese subtitles, anything you like, without the need to understand anything.

**SRS resources and best practices:**

- Get out of passive learning.
- Learn to use plugins like Image Occlusion Enhanced or Cloze Overlapper, Review Heatmap.
- Learn to use pre-made deck then build your custom deck.
  - Don't focus on formatting, it just words (and pictures).
- First few days: short cram session. Do as many as you can but only let it show 10-20 each time. => Less of what you don't know at a time, the better.
- After a week: intensive cram session. Learn all of them. => Cards are renewed and entered the algo.
- Going forward: the more the better, use all of your spare time.
- By month 2: spread out the interval. Now things you know shouldn't appear more than _once a week_. And anything you don't know still shows up every day.
- Combine with other learning methods: ELI5 + Feynman, deadline management,
