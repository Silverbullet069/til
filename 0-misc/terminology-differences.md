# Terminology Differences

<!-- tl;dr starts -->

I've been focused on understanding the precise definitions of technological terminologies. To achieve this, I compare each term with its similar counterparts.

## [dietderpsy's comment on Reddit about the relationship between Program, Software and Application](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/kl785y/program_vs_software_vs_application/gh7cv37/)

- Hardware - The physical machine.
- Software - A program that runs on hardware.
- Program - A sequence of computing instructions. A piece of papar with code is a program. A code snippet on Visual Studio Code is a program. Where the entity lives doesn't determine whether it's a program, the program just refers to the instructions.
- Process - A program loaded into memory.
- Application - A program designed for the end user for a specific purpose. Some programs are general-purposed (like OS), or do not run for the end user.

## [Productivity vs Efficiency â€“ What's the Difference?](https://trackingtime.co/productivity/productivity-vs-efficiency.html)

"Productivity" focuses on the **quantity of products**, concerns doing more within a specific timeframe. Overall, it describes how many items are produced.

"Efficiency" focuses on the **quantity of resources**, concerns doing the same amount of work (or more) using less time. Overall, it describes how well the resources are used.

## [Interpreted vs Compiled Programming Languages: What's the Difference?](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/compiled-versus-interpreted-languages/)

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
| Criteria | Compiled | Interpreted |
|---|---|---|
| Compilation output | Native machine code, Bytecode[^1] | None (or Bytecode in some implementations) |
| Execution target | System's processor, Interpreter (VM)[^1] | Interpreter (VM) |
| Platform-independent | No (if compiled into native machine code), Yes (if compiled into Bytecode) | Yes |
| Dynamic typing | Generally No (with exceptions) | Generally Yes |
| Execution speed | Fastest | Slower (though JIT[^2] can approach compiled speeds) |
| Program size | Larger (especially with static linking) | Smaller |
| Development cycle | Longer (compile-link-run) | Shorter (immediate execution) |
| Error detection | Mostly at compile time | Mostly at runtime |
| Memory management | Often manual or compiled-in | Usually automatic (garbage collection) |
| Examples | C, C++, Rust, Go, Java | JavaScript, Python, Ruby, Shell |

[^1]: Not every compiled programming language outputs native machine code at compilation step. Java compiled source code into bytecode and interpret it using JVM.
[^2]: Just-In-Time (or JIT) is a compilation strategy that converts frequently executed bytecode into native machine code for performance. This behavior happens at runtime, not during the compilation.

## [Technique Vs Method Vs Methodology](https://anthroholic.com/distinction-between-technique-method-and-methodology)

### Technique

Key points:

- Lowest-level.
- Represent the practical procedures employed to perform specific tasks.
- Learn through practice and experience.
- Can be highly specialized depending on the field or task.

Examples:

- Dicing vegetables, kneading dough, or tempering chocolate are "cooking techniques"
- Interviews, surveys, statistical analyses are "sampling techniques" in a research context.

### Method

Key points:

- Mid-level.
- Methods are organized, systematic procedure used to achieve a goal or solve a problem.
- Methods consist of a series of steps, each step often makes use of specific _techniques_.
- Methods are designed to solve problems or achieve high-level goals.

Examples:

- The "Montessori method" encourages self-directed activity and hands-on learning.
- In research, the "scientific method" involves steps like: formulating a hypothesis, designing and conducting an experiment, analyzing data and drawing conclusions.

### Methodology

Key points:

- Highest-level.
- Methodology refers to the theoretical analysis of the "methods" applied in a field. This analysis can be seen as a "framework" that guides the selection, use and interpretation of the methods and techniques employed.
- Methodology explains the "why" behind the chosen methods and techniques.

Examples:

- In software development, Agile methodology is used for managing complex projects. It incorporates various methods like Scrum, Kanban, and techniques such as sprints or stand-ups.

### Real-world examples that encompass all 3 terminology

1. Education

Imagine an English teacher tasked with improving students' essay writing skills:

- Techniques can be writing bullet points, developing strong thesis statements, incorporating evidence to support an argument, ...
- Method can be a systematic approach, such as teaching each techniques one at a time, teaching can be introducing, practicing by providing examples as references for students and doing exercises. Finally, combine all techinques for a full essay writing assignment.
- Methodology can be "constructivist learning" (learner construct knowledge through experiences and social interaction, integrating new information with their own existing knowledge), which emphasizes active student participation and "learning by doing".

2. Business and software development

Your company wants to practice Agile methodology:

- Techniques within Agile include daily [stand-up meeting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stand-up_meeting), retrospectives, pair programming, ...
- Methods within Agile are Scrum and Kanban, these are the methods that structure and organize the prior mentioned techniques to promote productivity and efficiency.
  > - "Productivity" focuses on the quantity of products, concerns doing more within a specific timeframe. Overall, it describes how many items are produced.
  > - "Efficiency" focuses on the quantity of resources, concerns doing the same amount of work (or more) using less time. Overall, it describes how well the resources are used.
- The Agile methodology, based on the Agile Manifesto, provides the theoretical framework that prioritizes high-level concepts such as individuals and interactions, working software, customer collaboration, responding to change.
